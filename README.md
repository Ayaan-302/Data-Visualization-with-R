# Data Visualization with R

Welcome to my repository showcasing the power of data visualization using R! This project explores a range of visualizations, each offering unique insights into data patterns and relationships. Below, youâ€™ll find highlights of the visualizations included in this project.

## Visualizations Highlights

### 1. Stripchart
- Compare height distributions across different weight categories.
- Offers a clear view of how height varies within specific weight groups.

### 2. Boxplot
- Display height variability by crop type.
- Highlights the range and outliers within each crop type group.

### 3. Histograms
- Analyze the distribution of height and weight.
- Provides a frequency distribution of height and weight data, revealing central tendencies and spread.

### 4. Scatterplot
- Investigate the correlation between height and weight.
- Visualizes the relationship and trends between two continuous variables.

### 5. QQ Plots
- Assess the normality of height and weight data.
- Helps determine if the data follows a normal distribution by comparing it against a theoretical normal distribution.

### 6. Mosaic Plot
- Map relationships between height and weight.
- Displays the association between categorical variables and their proportions.

### Running the Visualizations
1. Open the R script files in your preferred R environment.
2. Run the scripts to generate the visualizations.
3. Modify the datasets or visualization parameters to experiment further.

## Eager to Learn More
This project is a stepping stone in my journey to mastering data visualization with R. Iâ€™m excited to continue experimenting and diving deeper into the art and science of data visualization.
